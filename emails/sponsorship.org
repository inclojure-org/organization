Hello <Person, people>!

I'm writing to you on behalf of the IN/Clojure 2018 team.

Things with IN/Clojure have moved on further since the last time we
spoke. We've put out a tentative schedule, we've opened the CFP, and
all the details are on inclojure.org.

Just as a quick recap, IN/Clojure 2018 is the second edition of Asia's
first Clojure conference, and is scheduled to be held in Bengaluru
over two days - the 12th and the 13th of January, 2018. This edition
includes a one-day workshop on Clojure on the 12th and a single-track
presentations conference on the 13th.

<Why we think _this_ company should sponsor the conference> We'd be
very pleased if <Comany> can help grow the adoption - and community -
of Clojure in India by supporting this conference as a Sponsor. The
details for all slabs are included in the attached sponsorship
brochure.

We look forward to hearing from you soon!

Cheers,
Srihari Sriraman
(For the IN/Clojure 2018 team)
