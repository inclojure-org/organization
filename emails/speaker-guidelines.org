Hello, speakers!

It's great to have you on board.

A couple of things before we get to the guidelines:
1. We had requested for some details: contact, OS, ports, demo, etc. Please ensure you have responded to that.
2. As requested before, please let us know if you plan to have audio/video rich content in your talk. It'll help in being prepared.

Guidelines:

Have a well defined structure for your talk. Make sure your script has clearly defined introduction, middle, and end. If you don't have this yet, try to get it done by next week. See: [TED's guidelines on Outline + script](https://www.ted.com/participate/organize-a-local-tedx-event/tedx-organizer-guide/speakers-program/prepare-your-speaker/outline-script)
Have your slides prepared by Jan 5, and share them with us. This is so that we can verify them for compliance with the code of conduct, and provide feedback if any. It's alright if you make changes/tweaks afterwards. See: [TED's guidelines on creating and preparing slides](https://www.ted.com/participate/organize-a-local-tedx-event/tedx-organizer-guide/speakers-program/prepare-your-speaker/create-prepare-slides)
Rehearse, Rehearse, Rehearse. Start rehearsing today, if you can. If you would like an audience for your talk, we are happy to help. We can do rehearsals over hangouts. See: [TED's guidelines on rehearsals](https://www.ted.com/participate/organize-a-local-tedx-event/tedx-organizer-guide/speakers-program/prepare-your-speaker/rehearsals)

Do go through the TED guidelines in detail.

Let us know if you need anything at all. We're happy to help you with your talk, structure, slides, rehearsals. Travel, or stay related questions are welcome too.

Looking forward to this!

Cheers,
Srihari
