Subject: IN/Clojure Sponsorship: Next steps

Dear <CompanyName>,

Thank you so much for sponsoring IN/Clojure 2018!

As next steps, please share with us the following before 26th December:

1. A logo, preferably a vector in PDF, or a high res png. We'll use this in our website, banners, videos, etc.
2. A link, that would be the target landing page for clicking on your logo.
3. A brief writeup about the company in 200 words. We'll put this up on our website along with your logo.
3. A hiring blurb of 150-300 words. We'll send this out as a part of the hiring email to all attendees before the conference.

We'll also need the following delivered to the venue (Hotel Royal Orchid), by 9am on 12th January (day of the workshop):

1. Standees, with a maximum size of 6ft x 3ft. We'll put these up at the workshop rooms on 12th, and you can have it by your desk on 13th.
2. Handouts/Inserts, about 150 in number. A4 size marketing/hiring pamphlets we'll give to attendees during registration.
3. Stickers, or other small give-aways you want to add to the registration give-aways.

Also, please claim your <NumberOfTickets> tickets using discount code <IN/Clojure-2018-Sponsor-CompanyName> at http://inclojure.org/#tickets.

Thanks so much!
